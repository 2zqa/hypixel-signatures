# Hypixel.Paniek.de
## Signatures (images) with statistics and other tools

This project is the open source version of the 'new' hypixel.maxkorlaar.com, which will be moved over to hypixel.paniek.de.
The website is written in PHP using the Laravel framework.


### Priorities
Based on access logs from the 11th of April 2019 (I switched from Microsoft Azure to Scaleway around that time) until the 29nd of February 2020, this is the order of popularity for the signatures. The amount of hits in the access log is shown in parentheses, although these are rather inaccurate because of Cloudflare's proxy and caching.

* Main/general statistics (729252)
* Tooltip/general tooltip (491750)
* Bed Wars (439797)
* SkyWars (260097)
* Main small/small general statistics (173663)
* UHC Champions (119657)
