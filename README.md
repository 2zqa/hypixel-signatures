## Signatures (images) with statistics and other tools

This project is the open source version of the 'new' hypixel.maxkorlaar.com, which will be moved over to hypixel.paniek.de.
The website is written in PHP using the Laravel framework.


### Priorities
The signatures will be made based on a popularity vote. In [this Strawpoll](https://www.strawpoll.me/20018435), users can vote on the signatures they would most likely want to see and use.

### Acknowledgements
* This projects makes heavy use of [hypixel-php](https://github.com/Plancke/hypixel-php) by Plancke.
* For SkyBlock statistics, a lot of logic has been taken and inspired from the [skyblock-stats](https://github.com/LeaPhant/skyblock-stats) repository by Lea Seibert. I was kindly allowed to use her logic and variables in this project.
